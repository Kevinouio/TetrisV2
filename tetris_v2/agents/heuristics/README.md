# Heuristic & Search Baselines

Reference implementations for non-learning policies that are useful for
evaluation, behaviour cloning datasets, and reward shaping.

Planned implementations:

- Linear/hand-crafted board evaluation functions
- Beam search / lookahead placement policies
- Scripted openers or T-spin setup routines
- Random action agents for quick smoke tests
