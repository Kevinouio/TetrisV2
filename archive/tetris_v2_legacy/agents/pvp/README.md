# PvP / Battle-Tetris Agents

Algorithms for competitive two-player Tetris (garbage exchange, versus modes)
live here.  Implementations should build on the versus environment and support
self-play training.

Planned implementations:

- Self-play PPO / A2C
- Neural Fictitious Self-Play (NFSP)
- PSRO / league-based population training
- AlphaZero-style policy+value with MCTS for head-to-head play
