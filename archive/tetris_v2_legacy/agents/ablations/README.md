# Ablations & Comparative Studies

Utilities and experiment harnesses to compare algorithmic variants under a
shared protocol.  Use this area to quantify the impact of design choices.

Planned comparisons:

- Double vs. plain DQN (Q overestimation)
- PER vs. uniform replay
- NoisyNets vs. ε-greedy exploration
- PPO clip vs. KL-penalty objectives
- Distributional (C51/QR/IQN) vs. scalar Q estimates
